# CodeNection - Pathfinder 

## Track: Student Lifestyle  
**Problem Statement:** Tutoring for Students  

## Problem  
Students face burning questions every day that often go unanswered:  
- **Where do I start?** Too many resources make it overwhelming to begin.  
- **Inconsistent study habits** that hurt long-term progress.  
- **Lack of direction** without clear guidance or peer support.  

## Our Solution: Pathfinder  
> A guided learning companion.

Pathfinder helps students study with **clarity, efficiency, and community** through:  

1. **Smart Roadmaps**: official/curated study paths, progress tracking, discussions, and shared notes.  
2. **Peer-to-Peer Tutoring**: get real time help from peers through live chat, audio calls, and whiteboard collaboration.  
3. **Personalized Content**: subject tags and tailored recommendations to cut through the noise.
